# ArcDps-DX11-Updater
ArcDPS updater for GW2 using DX11 Beta

put arc-check-11.py in the Guildwars 2 directory - not the bin64 directory
remove version of d3d9.dll in bin64 if they exist
create a batch file to put on your desktop which will run the python script in the Guildwars 2 directory

Script will install d9d11.dll if it does not exist, update d9d11.dll if it is outdated, and let you that d9d11.dll is up to date.
